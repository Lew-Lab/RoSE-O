# RoSE - O 

## Overview 
RoSE - O(**R**obust**S**tatistical**E**stimation algorithm for single-molecule**O**rientation measurement) is a software package written in MATLAB to analyze single - molecule orientation & localization microscopy(SMOLM) data. 

## Getting started 
Copy the package in a folder on MATLAB path(tested on MATLAB 2018a). Run `startup.m`. For a basic usage, please refer to `doc` folder. 'RoSEODemo.m' demonstrates estimation of SMOLM by applying RoSE - O on a synthesized data set.
